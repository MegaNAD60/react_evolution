# **EVOLUTION AND IMPORTANCE OF REACT.**
React is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries in developing user interface. It is of no doubt that React have contributed greatly in software development industry over the years. This article looks at the evolvement of React and its importance in Tech industry.
## **What is React?**
React is a JavaScript library used in developing user interface. React was developed by Jordan Walke and it is used to develop single page application with the ability to interact with **Document Object Model (DOM)** and enable dynamic render of content. Although React.JS is basically used for building web app interface, React Native is used in developing iOS and Andriod mobile apps.
## **Evolution of React**
As stated earlier, React was developed by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook now known as META. Facebook had some challenges with her News Feed which then needed to be upgraded. Jordan Walke came up with a prototype call *'FaxJS'*, which was first deployed in 2011. FaxJS was able to solve the problem of Facebook News Feed enabling it to refresh without reloading the web page. By 2012, Facebook acquire Instagram and later on, FaxJS was deployed to Instagram.

On May 2013, React was officially launched and it became open-source at the JSConf in US. Maintained by Facebook (now Meta), React is used to create interactive web interface using components that are independent and reusable.

On February 2015, at the React Conference, **React Native** was announced and it became open-sourced later in March 2015. React Native becomes instrumental to software developers in developing iOS and Andriod apps, without the need to create separate codes.

On April 18 2017, Facebook announced a new set of algorithms for rendering known as React Fiber. This new innovations improves on the former algorithms known as Stack. Stack was known to be slow in rendering dynamic changes meanwhile, with Fibers, structure of page are broken into segments that makes it easy to maintain and update independently.

## **Importance of React**
* **Maintainability:** React apps are developed using components that are independent and reusable. This made React codes easy to read, understand, and maintain.
* **Virtual Document Object Model (DOM):** A virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React creates virtual dom in memory that helps in implementing all necessary manipulations before making the changes in browser DOM>
* **React Native:** React Native is a open-source UI that is used in creating iOS and Android mobile app without the need of writing separate codes for them.
* **Reusability:** React apps are developed with components, which are independent and reusable. In other words, these components can be used in several spot which in turn reduces the amount of codes to be written.

In summary, React is a robust and widely used JavaScript library in our society today. What started as an internal solution to Facebook news feed have over the years evolved and grow to be a powerful tool in building user interface. React have proven to be important as its features makes her standout in Software development.
